# Ranomega2 replacement clockwork electronics

This is an example running on a custom version of the P44-Device, the P44-rantomega2, which has 8 Omega2 GPIOs connected to two uniploar stepper motors for moving the minutes and hours digits of a
mechanical 7-segment clock (the Ranoge, which has inprecise electronics issuing slighly wrong number of steps, so a replacement controller was made)

It shows how to control DC stepper motors
